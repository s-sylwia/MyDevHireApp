# MyDevHireApp

This project is my independent work-in-progress application developed as part of a 12-month Java Developer bootcamp's final evaluation. It serves as an application for a company acting as an intermediary in hiring programmers.

## Business Use Cases

The following business use cases can be identified for this application:

1. The company needs to find programmers, so it creates an account in the application (represented by a company representative).
2. The company can define the criteria for the candidate they are looking for in their profile. Consider what information would be relevant from the employer's perspective.
3. Candidates can create an account in the application.
4. Candidates can complete their profiles and create their virtual CVs, including the option to upload a photo.
5. The company can search for candidates based on specific criteria. Consider what criteria could be used for the search.
6. Candidates can search for companies based on specific criteria. Consider what criteria could be used for the search.
7. The company can mark a candidate as hired, indicating that they are currently unavailable.
8. Candidates can mark themselves as not interested in job opportunities, which suspends their profile.
